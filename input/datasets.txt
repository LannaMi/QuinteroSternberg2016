# These are the expression datasets used for Quintero-Cadena and Sternberg (2016)
# These are all, or were converted to, gene quantification datasets (as opposed to transcript quantification)
# All were converted to transcripts per million (TPM) when necessary
# A separate file called encode_exp_mm.txt contains the links to the datasets used for M. musculus
