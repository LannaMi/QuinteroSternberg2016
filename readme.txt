This repository contains the main python code used for data analysis in
Quintero-Cadena and Sternberg (2016), as well as information of the datasets used (input directory).
There are two scripts:
neighboring_gene_functions.py, which includes every function necessary to do the analysis 
pairing_corr.py, which calls the functions in the previous script for each analyzed dataset
